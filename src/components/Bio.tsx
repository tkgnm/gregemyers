      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in Essex is a continuous source of influence for my work. My
        father is a engineer, meaning I spent a lot of time in scrap yards and
        industrial estates. This influenced my work’s aesthetic to use
        industrialisation contrasted with elements of nature as a representation
        for the digital age. Through utilising apps and readymade filters to
        distort and enhance my imagery, I explore how far you can use the
        manipulation of online platforms to drain the original meaning out of
        the image. I call this imagery “Earth Portals” as they become gateways
        to alternate spaces through transforming the surroundings in that we
        live. These portals leave space for viewers to engage with their own
        experiences when looking at the imagery permitting augmented realities,
        fictional narratives and shared beliefs. This is especially interesting
        in an age of processed selfies, AI generated images and fake news. We
        are perpetually bombarded with images that are constantly having their
        value and purpose redefined through data sets and algorithms. My
        practise asks questions of what is real once an image is created and
        manipulated and exploring the relevance art has to play in the virtual
        world.
